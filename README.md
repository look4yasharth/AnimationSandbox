# Animation Sandbox
This watchOS application that I built is all about animations. This app is an animation sandbox that lets user try out animation varieties quickly and easily. The app is designed to work alongside watch kids unique layout system. For example – user can animate alpha, set vertical horizontal alignments, relative width and height and tint colour as well as some other animations too. So if the user cycles through the loop he/she created, he/she can see each animation. User can also do exciting image animations.  

In this project, I learnt about working with attribute animation and image animation.
